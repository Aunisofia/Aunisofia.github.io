                    <P>During our comprehensive PC hardware training session, I had the valuable opportunity to learn about computer assembly under the guidance of our skilled lab assistant. The session began with an in-depth exploration of essential PC components, including the sophisticated motherboard, powerful processor (CPU), memory modules (RAM), storage devices (hard drive), reliable power supply unit, and efficient cooling system.
                       <br><br>
                        The hands-on portion of our training was particularly enlightening, as we carefully disassembled and reassembled the computer step by step. To validate our work, we conducted a test to served as practical confirmation of our assembly skills. The experience culminated in a knowledge assessment quiz, where we demonstrated our understanding on proper PC assembly techniques.
                       <br><br>  
                        This practical session not only enhanced our technical knowledge but also provided us with real-world experience in computer hardware manipulation and troubleshooting. The combination of theoretical learning and hands-on practice created a comprehensive understanding of PC assembly fundamentals.</P>
